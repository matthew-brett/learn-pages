## Recording

We will link to the recording here, after the Tuesday session.

## Schedule and plan

* About different levels of background Python and Numpy.
* About homework.

### Arrays, images and plotting

* [Introduction to Numpy](https://textbook.nipraxis.org/numpy_intro.html)
* [Arrays
  exercise](https://hub.nipraxis.org/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A//github.com/nipraxis/arrays&subPath=arrays.ipynb)

For those of you who have not used Numpy before, we recommend you read this page, and do this exercise:

* [Boolean indexing](https://textbook.nipraxis.org/boolean_indexing.html)
* [Boolean
  exercise](https://hub.nipraxis.org/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A//github.com/uob-cfd/boolean_arrays&subPath=boolean_arrays.ipynb)

Please see also the background from the tutorial pages from the [scipy lecture
notes]():

-   The [numpy array
    object](https://scipy-lectures.org/intro/numpy/array_object.html);
-   [Array operations](https://scipy-lectures.org/intro/numpy/operations.html).

If you know Matlab, you might want to look over this page on [Numpy for Matlab
users](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/numpy-for-matlab-users.html).

## For homework

**The homework listed at the end of the session notes is the homework for the whole week**.  You should do the homework **before the first session of week 3**.

When we list the homework in the notes for the first session, this is so you
can get started early.  But, even if we list the homework in the first
session, you only need to get the homework done for the beginning of the
following week.

## That's it.

That's it for this session.
