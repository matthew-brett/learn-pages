## Homework

In the next session, we will be starting with Git, and to work on your own
computer.

First, [install what you need](https://textbook.nipraxis.org/installation),
including the Git version control software.

Next, watch the following two videos introducing Git in use, but relating what
you see to the terms in the tutorial above.

I'm referring to the "Git parable" in the videos, which is a similar
introduction to the [Curious Git
tutorial](https://matthew-brett.github.io/curious-git) from last week's
homework â€” but the two tutorials take a very similar track, so you can consider
them interchangeable.

<p><a href="https://vimeo.com/121579300">Introduction to the git working tree, repository and staging area</a> from <a href="https://vimeo.com/matthewbrett">Matthew Brett</a> on <a href="https://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p>

The next video is a little out of date, in that the default branch name in Git
has changed from "master" to "main".  You will likely find your copy of Git
calls the default branch "main".  For "master" read "main" throughout.

## That's it.

That's it for this session.
