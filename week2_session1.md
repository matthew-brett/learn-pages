If you know Matlab, you might want to look over this page on [Numpy for Matlab
users](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/numpy-for-matlab-users.html).

## For homework

**The homework listed at the end of the session notes is the homework for the whole week**.  You should do the homework **before the first session of week 3**.

## That's it.

That's it for this session.
