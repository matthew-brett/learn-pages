## Schedule and plan

### Basic Python

* [Introduction to Numpy](https://textbook.nipraxis.org/numpy_intro.html)
* [Arrays
  exercise](https://hub.nipraxis.org/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A//github.com/nipraxis/arrays&subPath=arrays.ipynb)

## For homework

If you need to catch up on Python, you have a double-dose of homework this
week.  You really will need to do the first section here, to get fluent in using the basic Python language.

Everyone should do the Git reading.  This will be the foundation for the reproducible science stuff, next week.

### If you need to refresh your Python knowledge

If you don't know Python well, we strongly suggest you do these exercises to catch up, otherwise the rest of the course will be too fast.

First make sure you have read the [fast introduction to
Python](https://textbook.nipraxis.org/brisk_python.html).

If you are new to Python, do the [expressions and statements
exercise](https://hub.nipraxis.org/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A//github.com/uob-cfd/exprs_states&subPath=exprs_states.ipynb), to get into the swing of things.

Next, do these exercises from the [Google Python
class](https://developers.google.com/edu/python/).  There are links in the
exercises to the sections to read to revise the ideas you need.

- [string1 exercise](https://hub.nipraxis.org/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A//github.com/nipraxis/google_string1&subPath=string1.ipynb)
- [list1 exercise](https://hub.nipraxis.org/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A//github.com/nipraxis/google_list1&subPath=list1.ipynb)

We also suggest you try the slightly more advanced exercises:

- [string2 exercise](https://hub.nipraxis.org/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A//github.com/nipraxis/google_string2&subPath=string2.ipynb)
- [list2 exercise](https://hub.nipraxis.org/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A//github.com/nipraxis/google_list2&subPath=list2.ipynb)

These exercises are for some Python practice, and to get you used to the notebook interface.

### Git reading

Read, mark, learn and inwardly digest the [curious
git](https://matthew-brett.github.io/curious-git/) tutorial.

We think this will take you 90 minutes, at a careful read, and you will need
to read it carefully, in order to benefit from it.

If you do read it carefully, you will be investing in your own future
productivity â€” Git version control is a powerful way to work more efficiently,
especially in collaboration, and you need to understand the way that Git
**thinks**, in order to use Git with fluency and efficiency.

## The end

That's it for this session.
