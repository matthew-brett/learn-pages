## Schedule and plan


## For homework

Your revision is some practice programming in Python.

Read the [fast introduction to
Python](https://textbook.nipraxis.org/brisk_python.html).

Next do the [expressions and statements
exercise](https://hub.nipraxis.org/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A//github.com/uob-cfd/exprs_states&subPath=exprs_states.ipynb)

Finally, do these two exercises from the [Google Python
class](https://developers.google.com/edu/python/).  There are links in the
exercises to the sections to read to revise the ideas you need.

- [string1 exercise](https://hub.nipraxis.org/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A//github.com/nipraxis/google_string1&subPath=string1.ipynb)
- [list1 exercise](https://hub.nipraxis.org/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A//github.com/nipraxis/google_list1&subPath=list1.ipynb)

Consider doing:

- [string2 exercise](https://hub.nipraxis.org/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A//github.com/nipraxis/google_string2&subPath=string2.ipynb)
- [list2 exercise](https://hub.nipraxis.org/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A//github.com/nipraxis/google_list2&subPath=list2.ipynb)


That's it for the first session.
