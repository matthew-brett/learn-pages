## For homework

This is the homework for Thursday 21st / Friday 22nd.

We will update it on Wednesday 12 April.

First, read, mark, learn and inwardly digest the [curious
git](https://matthew-brett.github.io/curious-git/) tutorial.

We think this will take you 90 minutes, at a careful read.

Next, watch the following two videos introducing Git in use, but relating what you see to the terms in the tutorial above.

I'm referring to the "Git parable" in the videos, which is a
similar introduction to the "Curious Git" tutorial above â€” but
the two tutorials take a very similar track, so you can
consider them interchangeable.

<p><a href="https://vimeo.com/121579300">Introduction to the git working tree, repository and staging area</a> from <a href="https://vimeo.com/matthewbrett">Matthew Brett</a> on <a href="https://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p>

The next video is a little out of date, in that the default branch name in Git has changed from "master" to "main".  You will likely find your copy of Git calls the default branch "main".  For "master" read "main" throughout.

## That's it.

That's it for this session.
