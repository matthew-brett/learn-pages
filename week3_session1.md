## Schedule and plan

* About different levels of background Python and Numpy.
* About homework.

### 4D arrays and time series

- Loading images with [nibabel];
- 4D images as collections of 3D images;
- getting volumes from 4D images;
- getting time-series from 4D images by slicing;
- intro page: {doc}`intro_to_4d`;
- exercise: {doc}`four_dimensions_exercise`.

## For homework

**The homework listed at the end of the session notes is the homework for the whole week**.  You should do the homework **before the first session of week 3**.

When we list the homework in the notes for the first session, this is so you
can get started early.  But, even if we list the homework in the first
session, you only need to get the homework done for the beginning of the
following week.

- Read, learn, inwardly digest the [curious git] tutorial;
- Watch the videos at {doc}`git_videos`.

## That's it.

That's it for this session.
