## For homework

**The homework listed at the end of the session notes is the homework for the whole week**.  You should do the homework **before the first session of week 3**.

When we list the homework in the notes for the first session, this is so you
can get started early.  But, even if we list the homework in the first
session, you only need to get the homework done for the beginning of the
following week.

- Read, mark, learn and inwardly digest the [curious
  git](https://matthew-brett.github.io/curious-git/) tutorial;

More will follow.

## That's it.

That's it for this session.
