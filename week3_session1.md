## Recording

We will post this with 24 hours after the session.

## Schedule

* Again, towards the project.
* Bracketing Git, Github and working on your own computer.

### Some background

You will need to have followed the [installation
instructions](https://textbook.nipraxis.org/installation.html).

In particular, you are about to use your terminal application:

* [Powershell on Windows]()
* [Terminal.app on
  Mac](https://textbook.nipraxis.org/installation_on_mac.html#terminal-app)
* [Powshell on
  Mac](https://textbook.nipraxis.org/installation_on_windows.html#powershell)

### Modules and functions

We start with the laptop way.

* [on_modules](https://textbook.nipraxis.org/on_modules).

```
git clone https://github.com/nipraxis/first_module
cd first_module
ipython
```

then (in IPython):

```
run spm_funcs.py
```

On debugging.

* [Assert in Python](https://textbook.nipraxis.org/assert.html)

### A Git walkthrough

See: <https://github.com/nipraxis/first-validation>

## For homework

### Using Git

Watch the following two videos introducing Git in use, but relating what you
see to the terms in the [curious
git](https://matthew-brett.github.io/curious-git/) tutorial from last week.

I'm referring to the "Git parable" in the videos, which is a similar
introduction to the [Curious Git
tutorial](https://matthew-brett.github.io/curious-git) from last week's
homework — but the two tutorials take a very similar track, so you can
consider them interchangeable.

<p><a href="https://vimeo.com/121579300">Introduction to the git working tree, repository and staging area</a> from <a href="https://vimeo.com/matthewbrett">Matthew Brett</a> on <a href="https://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p>

The next video is a little out of date, in that the default branch name in Git
has changed from "master" to "main".  You will likely find your copy of Git
calls the default branch "main".  For "master" read "main" throughout.

### Choosing a text editor

Your second job for this week is to assess and [choose a text
editor](https://textbook.nipraxis.org/choosing_editor.html).

Here we a list of videos on choosing text editors:

* Edited version of [Stéfan van der Walt on
  Emacs](https://vimeo.com/740066780) (16 minutes).  You might prefer the [full
  24 minute version of the conversation here](https://vimeo.com/702404210).
* [Pamphile Roy on PyCharm](https://vimeo.com/702001724) (16 minutes).
* Edited version of [Ilhan Polat on Spyder](https://vimeo.com/702215618) (14
  minutes).  You can also watch the [54 minute full conversation with Ilhan](https://vimeo.com/706101324).
* [Bhuvak Kalra on VSCode](https://vimeo.com/702402879) (16 minutes).
* Edited version of [Paul Ivanov on
  Vim](https://vimeo.com/740121174) (15 minutes).  You can watch the [full 43
  minute conversation with Paul Ivanov here](https://vimeo.com/704733982). You
  might watch the full version if you interested in more on how you know when
  you have the right editor, how long it takes to get going with Vim.

Please take time for this task, and investigate your options.

### If you need practice

* [Boolean indexing
  exercise](https://hub.nipraxis.org/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A//github.com/uob-cfd/boolean_arrays&subPath=boolean_arrays.ipynb)

### If you didn't finish it

* [Arteries
  exercise](https://hub.nipraxis.org/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A//github.com/nipraxis/arteries&subPath=arteries.ipynb)

## That's it.

That's it for this session.
