## For homework

### Using Git

Next, watch the following two videos introducing Git in use, but relating what
you see to the terms in the tutorial above.

I'm referring to the "Git parable" in the videos, which is a similar
introduction to the [Curious Git
tutorial](https://matthew-brett.github.io/curious-git) from last week's
homework â€” but the two tutorials take a very similar track, so you can consider
them interchangeable.

The next video is a little out of date, in that the default branch name in Git
has changed from "master" to "main".  You will likely find your copy of Git
calls the default branch "main".  For "master" read "main" throughout.

### If you need practice

* [Boolean indexing
  exercise](https://hub.nipraxis.org/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A//github.com/uob-cfd/boolean_arrays&subPath=boolean_arrays.ipynb)

### If you didn't finish it

* [Arteries
  exercise](https://hub.nipraxis.org/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A//github.com/nipraxis/arteries&subPath=arteries.ipynb)

## That's it.

That's it for this session.
