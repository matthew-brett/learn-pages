This is a reply to one of your fellow students.  They asked me whether the choice of editor came down to difference in personal preference.

## Choice of editor and personal preference

I think it would be better to say that the choice is often influenced by
personal history - for example - what editor you start with.  On the other
hand, my strong speculation would be that personal idiosyncrasy has little to
do with how productive you can become with any one particular editor.  For
example, no matter who you are, and what your preferences are, if you stick in
the Jupyter Notebook interface as your code editor, you are going to be much
slower at writing code and many other tasks, in the long term, than if you
adopt a serious editor like the ones you see here.  And it's difficult to
believe that won't also be true, over the long term, for differences between
the editors listed here.

So my advice would be - don't pay much attention to what people say about their editor, if they haven't given other editors a serious try.  For example, I used Emacs for 10 years, and then switched to Vim, and I can tell you I am more productive in Vim than I was in Emacs.  But if someone started using Vim, and has only tried out - say - PyCharm for 30 minutes - their opinion on the desirability of Vim over PyCharm is not worth much.

On the other hand - do watch people using their editors, and see whether they
are being efficient.  The sign of someone using an editor efficiently is that
they are doing tasks so quickly that you can't see immediately see how they
did it.  You'll get the idea if you watch an experienced user of any editor.
Then watch a Vim user — say — and a really experienced PyCharm user — say
— and see who is moving quicker through their work.  And even — get them to
talk you through it, as they work — if the editor is working well for them,
they will be able to talk while they are typing and doing other tasks,
because the editor has become second-nature.  If they have to pause talking
to do things such as — for example — save the file, or switch between files,
that's a good sign that the editor is still distracting.
