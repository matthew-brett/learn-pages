* [Test one voxel](https://textbook.nipraxis.org/model_one_voxel.html)
* [Multi-voxel estimation](https://textbook.nipraxis.org/multi_multiply.html)
* [Multi-model exercise](https://hub.nipraxis.org/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A//github.com/nipraxis/multi_model&subPath=multi_model.ipynb)
* [Matrix rank](https://textbook.nipraxis.org/matrix_rank.html)

  model](https://textbook.nipraxis.org/mean_test_example.html)

## Homework

Make sure you have done the  [on estimation
exercise](https://hub.nipraxis.org/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A//github.com/nipraxis/on_estimation&subPath=on_estimation.ipynb)
from last week, and the [dummy hypothesis
exercise](https://hub.nipraxis.org/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A//github.com/nipraxis/dummy_hypothesis&subPath=dummy_hypothesis.ipynb) from this session.

## That's it.

That's it for this session.
