The *second session* is the Thursday or Friday session â€” whichever you have
chosen to join.

These are the notes for the second session, for week 2.

We will update them before and after the session, to please keep checking back for updates.  Just refresh the page in your browser to get updates.

* Thursday 15:00 UTC session: [Thursday Zoom

* Friday 18:00 UTC session: [Friday Zoom link](https://bham-ac-uk.zoom.us/j/82522323304?pwd=VjRRWDNkZjF5clBDd3FNNGJWcTUyZz09).

## Recording

We will link to the recording here, after the Friday session.

## New!  Discussion Forum
We have created a [Nipraxis space](https://matrix.to/#/#nipraxis:matrix.org) on Element/matrix.org.

The purpose of this forum is to allow students to interact with instructors
and each other, semi-synchronously, outside of email. If you are familiar with Slack, it is intended to be similar to that.

If you already have a Matrix account, the above link will allow you to join.
If you do not, the easiest way to get started is to use the Element web app:
<https://app.element.io/#/room/#nipraxis:matrix.org>

From here, if you click "Join", you will be given the opportunity to sign in or create an account.

Once you have joined, please also join the "Spring 2022" room, which will be used exclusively for this session of the course.
After an open period, we will be making this room private so that discussions are not broadly viewable.

Don't worry. If you join after this period, we can still invite you into the room.

## For homework

**The homework listed at the end of the session notes is the homework for the whole week**.  You should do the homework **before the first session of week 3**.

When we list the homework in the notes for the first session, this is so you
can get started early.  But, even if we list the homework in the first
session, you only need to get the homework done for the beginning of the
following week.

The homework for this week has three parts:

### Read the scipy-lecture pages on Numpy

Here are the links again:

-   The [numpy array
    object](https://scipy-lectures.org/intro/numpy/array_object.html);
-   [Array operations](https://scipy-lectures.org/intro/numpy/operations.html).

If you know Matlab, you might want to look over this page on [Numpy for Matlab
users](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/numpy-for-matlab-users.html).

We think this will take you about 40 minutes, reading carefully.

### Numpy exercise

This exercise will stretch your Numpy knowledge from the pages above:

[Numpy
practice](https://hub.nipraxis.org/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A//github.com/nipraxis/array_practice&subPath=array_practice.ipynb)

We think this will take about 45 minutes.

### Install Python and other libraries on your computer

See [installation](https://textbook.nipraxis.org/installation)

We think this will take you about 20 minutes.  If you have any problems, please contact us, we'll help.

## That's it.

That's it for this session.
