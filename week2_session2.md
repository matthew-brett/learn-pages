The *second session* is the Thursday or Friday session â€” whichever you have
chosen to join.

These are the notes for the second session, for week 2.

We will update them before and after the session, to please keep checking back for updates.  Just refresh the page in your browser to get updates.

## Recording

[Thursday Week 2 session 2 recording](https://bham-ac-uk.zoom.us/rec/share/XDcugNcNDMPXwIkH4u7Nrwjs11ScP-lZBIkUjLmNI0Rho2mQPNyqSemGo_7hIoaa.PfYSEc7wt1HgItWJ)

## New!  Discussion Forum

We have created a Nipraxis space over at Element/matrix.org

The purpose of this forum is to allow you to interact with us, your
instructors, and each other, semi-synchronously, outside of email. If you are
familiar with Slack, we intend it to be similar to that.

We suggest you join the room using your Github account, as follows.

To join, click on [the Nipraxis space
link](https://app.element.io/#/room/#nipraxis:matrix.org).

Click "Join" to join the Nipraxis space.

Choose "Sign in" from the next page (do *not* choose "Create Account", because you will be using your Github account).

Assuming you do not already have a Matrix.org account, we suggest you then
click on the Github icon at the bottom left of the pop-up window (hover
message "Continue with Github").  Follow the instructions.  *Make sure you
copy and store your backup key as instructed*.

Once you have joined, please also join the "Spring 2022" room, which will be
used exclusively for this session of the course. After an open period, we will
be making this room private so that discussions are not broadly viewable.

Don't worry. If you join after this period, we can still invite you into the room.

## Schedule and plan

* Discussion forum
* If you already know Numpy
* Plan for next week

### Arrays and images

* [Arrays and images](https://textbook.nipraxis.org/arrays_and_images)
* [Camera
  exercise](https://hub.nipraxis.org/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A//github.com/nipraxis/camera&subPath=camera.ipynb)
* [Arrays in 3D](https://textbook.nipraxis.org/arrays_3d)

## For homework

**The homework listed at the end of the session notes is the homework for the whole week**.  You should do the homework **before the first session of week 3**.

When we list the homework in the notes for the first session, this is so you
can get started early.  But, even if we list the homework in the first
session, you only need to get the homework done for the beginning of the
following week.

The homework for this week has three parts:

### Read the scipy-lecture pages on Numpy

Here are the links again:

-   The [numpy array
    object](https://scipy-lectures.org/intro/numpy/array_object.html);
-   [Array operations](https://scipy-lectures.org/intro/numpy/operations.html).

If you know Matlab, you might want to look over this page on [Numpy for Matlab
users](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/numpy-for-matlab-users.html).

We think this will take you about 40 minutes, reading carefully.

### Numpy exercise

This exercise will stretch your Numpy knowledge from the pages above:

[Numpy
practice](https://hub.nipraxis.org/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A//github.com/nipraxis/array_practice&subPath=array_practice.ipynb)

We think this will take about 45 minutes.

### Install Python and other libraries on your computer

See [installation](https://textbook.nipraxis.org/installation)

We think this will take you about 20 minutes.  If you have any problems, please contact us, we'll help.

## That's it.

That's it for this session.
