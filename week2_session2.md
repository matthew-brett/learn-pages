## Recording

We will post this after the session.

## The day

Notice the homework, and in particular, the sections on Choosing a Text Editor,
and Markdown.

### Into three dimensions

* [Arrays in 3D](https://textbook.nipraxis.org/arrays_3d)
* [Images in 3D](https://textbook.nipraxis.org/images_3d)
* [Reshape and 3D](https://textbook.nipraxis.org/reshape_and_3d)
* [Anatomical
  exercise](https://hub.nipraxis.org/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A//github.com/nipraxis/anatomical&subPath=anatomical.ipynb)
* If you have finished the Anatomical exercise, try the [Arteries
  exercise](https://hub.nipraxis.org/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A//github.com/nipraxis/arteries&subPath=arteries.ipynb)

### A git walkthrough

## For homework

### If you are not yet secure using Numpy arrays

Read:

* The [numpy array
  object](https://scipy-lectures.org/intro/numpy/array_object.html);
* [Array operations](https://scipy-lectures.org/intro/numpy/operations.html).
* If you know Matlab, you might want to look over this page on [Numpy for
  Matlab users](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/numpy-for-matlab-users.html).

We think this will take you about 40 minutes, reading carefully.

Then do this exercise, to stretch your Numpy knowledge from the pages above:

* [Numpy
  practice](https://hub.nipraxis.org/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A//github.com/nipraxis/array_practice&subPath=array_practice.ipynb)

We think the exercise will take about 45 minutes.

### For everyone - getting set up on your own computer

Your job for this week is to assess and [choose a text
editor](https://textbook.nipraxis.org/choosing_editor.html).

Here we a list of videos on choosing text editors:

* [Stéfan van der Walt on Emacs](https://vimeo.com/702404210)
* [Pamphile Roy on PyCharm](https://vimeo.com/702001724)
* Short version of [Ilhan Polat on Spyder](https://vimeo.com/702215618).  You
  can also watch the [54 minute full conversation with
  Ilhan](https://vimeo.com/706101324).
* [Bhuvak Kalra on VSCode](https://vimeo.com/702402879)
* [Paul Ivanov on Vim](https://vimeo.com/704733982).  This video is about 43
  minutes, and longer than the others, I will edit it down to 10 minutes in
  due course.  It might be interesting for a more general discussion of how you know when you have the right editor, how long it takes to get going with Vim, and other stuff.

Please take time for this task, and investigate your options.

### For everyone - the Markdown tutorial

Markdown is the standard way of writing nicely formatted text on many
platforms, including on Github, and in the Jupyter notebook.  You will see it
in many places, and you will find yourself using it often — for example, in
Jupyter text cells.  Get used to writing Markdown by doing the [Markdown
tutorial](https://www.markdowntutorial.com).

## That's it.

That's it for this session.
