## Recording

We will post this after the session.

### Arrays and images

* [Arrays and images](https://textbook.nipraxis.org/arrays_and_images)
* [Camera
  exercise](https://hub.nipraxis.org/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A//github.com/nipraxis/camera&subPath=camera.ipynb)
* [Arrays in 3D](https://textbook.nipraxis.org/arrays_3d)

## For homework

### If you are not yet secure using Numpy arrays

Read:

* The [numpy array
  object](https://scipy-lectures.org/intro/numpy/array_object.html);
* [Array operations](https://scipy-lectures.org/intro/numpy/operations.html).
* If you know Matlab, you might want to look over this page on [Numpy for
  Matlab users](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/numpy-for-matlab-users.html).

We think this will take you about 40 minutes, reading carefully.

Then do this exercise, to stretch your Numpy knowledge from the pages above:

* [Numpy
  practice](https://hub.nipraxis.org/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A//github.com/nipraxis/array_practice&subPath=array_practice.ipynb)

We think the exercise will take about 45 minutes.

## That's it.

That's it for this session.
