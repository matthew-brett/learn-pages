## For homework

**The homework listed at the end of the session notes is the homework for the whole week**.  You should do the homework **before the first session of week 3**.

When we list the homework in the notes for the first session, this is so you
can get started early.  But, even if we list the homework in the first
session, you only need to get the homework done for the beginning of the
following week.

The homework for this week has three parts:

### Read the scipy-lecture pages on Numpy

Here are the links again:

-   The [numpy array
    object](https://scipy-lectures.org/intro/numpy/array_object.html);
-   [Array operations](https://scipy-lectures.org/intro/numpy/operations.html).

If you know Matlab, you might want to look over this page on [Numpy for Matlab
users](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/numpy-for-matlab-users.html).

We think this will take you about 40 minutes, reading carefully.

### Numpy exercise

This exercise will stretch your Numpy knowledge from the pages above:

[Numpy
practice](https://hub.nipraxis.org/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A//github.com/nipraxis/array_practice&subPath=array_practice.ipynb)

We think this will take about 45 minutes.

### Install Python and other libraries on your computer

See [installation](https://textbook.nipraxis.org/installation)

We think this will take you about 20 minutes.  If you have any problems, please contact us, we'll help.

## That's it.

That's it for this session.
