* [Reshaping and three
  dimensions](https://textbook.nipraxis.org/reshape_and_3d.html)

  exercise](https://hub.nipraxis.org/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A//github.com/nipraxis/anatomical&subPath=anatomical.ipynb)
* If you have time: [Arteries
  exercise](https://hub.nipraxis.org/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A//github.com/nipraxis/arteries&subPath=arteries.ipynb)

Notice the homework, and in particular, the sections on Choosing a Text Editor,
and Markdown.

### A git walkthrough

See: <https://github.com/nipraxis/first-validation>

## For homework

### If you are not yet secure using Numpy arrays

Read:

* The [numpy array
  object](https://scipy-lectures.org/intro/numpy/array_object.html);
* [Array operations](https://scipy-lectures.org/intro/numpy/operations.html).

We think this will take you about 40 minutes, reading carefully.

Then do this exercise, to stretch your Numpy knowledge from the pages above:

* [Numpy
  practice](https://hub.nipraxis.org/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A//github.com/nipraxis/array_practice&subPath=array_practice.ipynb)

We think the exercise will take about 45 minutes.

### For everyone - getting set up on your own computer

Your job for this week is to assess and [choose a text
editor](https://textbook.nipraxis.org/choosing_editor.html).

Here we a list of videos on choosing text editors:

* Edited version of [Stéfan van der Walt on
  Emacs](https://vimeo.com/740066780) (16 minutes).  You might prefer the [full
  24 minute version of the conversation here](https://vimeo.com/702404210).
* [Pamphile Roy on PyCharm](https://vimeo.com/702001724) (16 minutes).
* Edited version of [Ilhan Polat on Spyder](https://vimeo.com/702215618) (14
  minutes).  You can also watch the [54 minute full conversation with Ilhan](https://vimeo.com/706101324).
* [Bhuvak Kalra on VSCode](https://vimeo.com/702402879) (16 minutes).
* Edited version of [Paul Ivanov on
  Vim](https://vimeo.com/740121174) (15 minutes).  You can watch the [full 43
  minute conversation with Paul Ivanov here](https://vimeo.com/704733982). You
  might watch the full version if you interested in more on how you know when
  you have the right editor, how long it takes to get going with Vim.

Please take time for this task, and investigate your options.

### For everyone - the Markdown tutorial

Markdown is the standard way of writing nicely formatted text on many
platforms, including on Github, and in the Jupyter notebook.  You will see it
in many places, and you will find yourself using it often — for example, in
Jupyter text cells.  Get used to writing Markdown by doing the [Markdown
tutorial](https://www.markdowntutorial.com).

## That's it.

That's it for this session.
