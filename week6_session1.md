## Recording

We didn't record the first half of the session, so [here is a new

This is the recording for [the second half of week 6 session

### Homework

* Agree a provisional project analysis plan with your group.  Don't worry about
  the detail, it's just a draft to get the discussion going, or even just to
  clarify your ideas about what the task is.
* Write it up as `analysis_plan.md` and make a pull request to your upstream repository.
*   When you think it is ready to merge, @ mention the instructors by
    adding a comment to the pull-request on the lines of:

    > @nipraxis-fall-2022/instructors - this plan is now ready for review.

    We will review your analysis plan, discuss and then Approve it using the
    Github interface.

## That's it.

That's it for this session.
