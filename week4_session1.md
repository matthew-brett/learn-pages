## For homework

### For everyone - the Markdown tutorial

Markdown is the standard way of writing nicely formatted text on many
platforms, including on Github, and in the Jupyter notebook.  You will see it
in many places, and you will find yourself using it often â€” for example, in
Jupyter text cells.  Get used to writing Markdown by doing the [Markdown
tutorial](https://www.markdowntutorial.com).

* Make sure you've read and understood the
  [on_modules](https://textbook.nipraxis.org/on_modules) page, and particularly
  the last sections.
* Then do the [voxel time course
  exercise](https://hub.nipraxis.org/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A//github.com/nipraxis/first_activation_exercise&subPath=first_activation.ipynb)
