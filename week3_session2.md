## For homework

This is the homework for Monday 25th / Tuesday 26th.

First, finish:

* [Four dimensions
  exercise](https://hub.nipraxis.org/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A//github.com/nipraxis/four_dimensions&subPath=four_dimensions.ipynb)

Next, for this coming week, we will start switching to use your own computers.

Make sure you have followed the instructions for
[installation](https://textbook.nipraxis.org/installation).

Your next job is to [choose a text
editor](https://textbook.nipraxis.org/choosing_editor.html).

Here we will have an expanding list of videos on choosing text editors:

* [Pamphile Roy on PyCharm](https://vimeo.com/702001724)
* [Ilhan Polat on Spyder](https://vimeo.com/702215618)
* [Stéfan van der Walt on Emacs]
* [Bhuvak Kalra on VSCode](https://vimeo.com/702402879)

Please take time for this task, and investigate your options.  We will post
new videos on the different editors over the next few days.

## That's it.

That's it for this session.
